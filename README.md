Python-Projects[]
A collection of my Python projects

[Project I]: A Beautfiul Soup webscraper that scrapes a car dealership website (truecar.com) for used vehicles and outputs the information into an excel file, outputing the vehicles(Model, Price, Location, Potential delivery locations).

  //The functionality of the project is finished
  //Need to make it more accessible, by cleaning up the excel sheet format
  


[Project II]: A application with a GUI that takes in user input on movies and shows to appends them into a list, categorised as (Name, Type, Personal Rating)
  //Work in progress
